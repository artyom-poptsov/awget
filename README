			awget

Awget is yet another download manager.  It is aimed for using with
Awesome window manager, but unfortunately written in Scheme instead of
Lua.

This download manager consist of awget console tool and awgetd daemon
which actually does all work.

Awget has got the following dependences:

  * GNU Guile 1.8+
  * wget
  * libnotify

Note that this project is under quite active development, and probably
it lacks some _very important features_ you might expect and/or
contains annoying bugs.


	BECAUSE OF BETA STATUS...

Because of beta status, you should go through some additional steps to
try awget in the action.

First of all, add a directory with awget sources to the Guile load
path:

  $ export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=${GUILE_LOAD_PATH}:~/bin/awget

or

  $ export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=${GUILE_LOAD_PATH}:/usr/local/share/awget

if you've installed awget (see the next section).  You can put this in
/etc/profile or shell's config file in your home directory.

Then create the /var/run/awget dir in which awget will store its .pid
file to track daemon status:

  $ su -
  # mkdir /var/run/awget
  # chown your-login-name:your-group /var/run/awget

If awgetd stopped abnormally, do the following to get awget working
again:

  $ rm /run/awget/awget.pid
  $ rm ~/.awget/awget


	INSTALLING

Awget can be installed in the classical manner:

  $ ./configure
  $ sudo make install

See INSTALL for general information about installation.  

The program will be installed in /usr/local/bin and Scheme sources
will be placed in /usr/local/share/awget directory by default.


	USAGE

Normally awgetd will be started as soon as you try to add the first
link.  But you can start the daemon manually by calling awget with
"-d" option:

  $ awget -d

Now you can add a new link that will be put in a queue for download:

  $ awget -a ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-2.0.0.tar.gz

The '-n' (or '--link') option can be used for setting the current link
for further operations.  The option takes a link ID as a parameter.
Link ID can be gained from the first column of the '-l' output.  For
example, to remove the first link from awget, you should use '-n'
option along with '-r' (or '--remove'):

  $ awget -n 1 -r

To get brief information about awget usage and possible options type:

  $ awget -h

Also the standard Guile tool display-commentary can be used to get
extra information about files:

  $ guile-tools display-commentary awget.scm

You can configure wget through the ~/.wgetrc file.  See the GNU Info
entry for wget for more information.
