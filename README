Awget is yet another download manager.  It is aimed for using with
[[http://awesome.naquadah.org/][Awesome]] window manager, but unfortunately written in Scheme instead of
Lua.

This download manager consist of awget console tool and awgetd daemon
which actually does all work.

* Requirements

Awget has got the following dependences:

 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]] 1.8+
 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile-rpc/][GNU Guile-RPC]]
 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/][wget]]
 - [[https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/][libnotify]]

Note that this project is under quite active development, and probably
it lacks some _very important features_ you might expect and/or
contains annoying bugs.

* Installation

Awget can be installed in the classical manner:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./configure
  $ sudo make install
#+END_EXAMPLE

See INSTALL for general information about installation.

The program will be installed in =/usr/local/bin= and Scheme sources
will be placed in =/usr/local/share/awget= directory by default.

There is an script for OpenRC, so you can manage awgetd with the
standard tool =rc-config= in [[http://www.gentoo.org/][Gentoo GNU/Linux]] distribution.  First of
all, copy the file to the =/etc/init.d= directory:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ sudo cp etc/init.gentoo /etc/init.d/awgetd
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then create a symlink to awgetd for the every user that should be able
to use awgetd as a service:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ sudo ln -s awget /etc/init.d/awgetd.$USER
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage

Normally awgetd will be started as soon as you try to add the first
link.  But you can start the daemon manually by calling awget with
`-d' option:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ awget -d
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you can add a new link that will be put in a queue for download:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ awget -a ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-2.0.0.tar.gz
#+END_EXAMPLE

The `-n' (or `--link') option can be used for setting the current link
for further operations.  The option takes a link ID as a parameter.
Link ID can be gained from the first column of the `-l' output.  For
example, to remove the first link from awget, you should use `-n'
option along with `-r' (or `--remove'):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ awget -n 1 -r
#+END_EXAMPLE

To get brief information about awget usage and possible options type:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ awget -h
#+END_EXAMPLE

Also the standard Guile tool =display-commentary= can be used to get
extra information about files:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ guile-tools display-commentary awget.scm
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can configure wget through the =~/.config/awget/wgetrc= file.  See
the GNU Info entry for =wget= for more information.

If awgetd stopped abnormally, do the following to get awget working
again:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rm /run/awget/awget.pid
  $ rm ~/.cache/awget/awget
#+END_EXAMPLE
